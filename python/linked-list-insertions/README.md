### Problem Domain
******
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- **append**

    arguments: new value
   adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- **insert before**

   arguments: value, new value
   adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

- **insert after**

   arguments: value, new value
   adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

### Structure and Testing

- [x] Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
- [x] Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list

- [x] Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list

- [x] Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list

- [x] Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
- [x] Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list


### Stretch Goal
Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, write an additional method to delete a node with the given value from the linked list
