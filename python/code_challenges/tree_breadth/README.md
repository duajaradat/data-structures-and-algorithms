### Problem Domain

***Feature Tasks***

**- Breadth first Search**
- Write a function called breadth first
     - Arguments: tree
     - Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
*NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach*

### Structure and Testing

- [x] “Happy Path” - Expected outcome
- [x] Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)
